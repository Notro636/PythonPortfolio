# My Portfolio Projects - Python

Since I am working on my portfolio with a variety of languages for my portfolio, this repository is for my Python projects. 

**DISCLAIMER**: Python is not my primary language while coding, so my code may have issues, this is a learning experience for me and my area of work.


### The projects I have worked on in Python

I am using a couple websites for ideas on **what** to make, I make the code from scratch, not using a template or other projects on GitHub.

* Website Scraper
    * A website scraper that makes a website map in XML, kind of like a generator that does it for you.
    * Uses the terminal for access (obviously), the only arguments you need are the following:
        * `-w` - The website you want to scrape.
        * `-o` - The output file to create and fill out.
* File Organizer
    * This organizes the files in a directory you specify that most likely doesn't have any form of organization.
        * There are a few ways that you can specify the types of files you need to organize using a couple of arguments
            * `--docs` - Only organize document files
            * `--audio` - Only organize audio files
            * `--video` - Only organize video files
            * `-a` - Organize everything at once
            * `--dir` - The directory you want to organize, by default this is the working directory.
